- 👋 Hi, I’m @FedericoLahm, currently living a digital nomad life, enjoying the perks of travelling and working on what brings me purpose. I have 13+ years of experience in Business Analysis, Project and Product Management, especially on Agile environments with software products.
- 👀 I’m interested in creating interactive books / blogs / education manuals to help and ease up the reading/studying of overly complicated books and motivate readers to learn and enjoy their reading journey.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML / CSS / JavaScript and aiming to become a Full Stack Web Developer.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that require requirements analysis and that involve books technology.
